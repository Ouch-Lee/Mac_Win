Since the successful completion of the first fiberoptic endoscope diagnostic procedure in 1957 [1], natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) has garnered significant attention and advancement. In the 1970s, the concept of using endoscopes for basic surgical interventions began to emerge. In 1980, Michael W.L. described the 'Gastric Puncture Without Laparotomy' procedure for 12 children and 19 adults, marking a milestone in the feasibility of endoscopic surgery [2]. This pioneering work paved the way for exploring more intricate surgical procedures using endoscopy, eventually formalized as the NOTES concept in 2005 [3]. Compared to conventional open surgeries, NOTES offers several advantages, including reduced risk of wound infections and incisional hernias [4], facilitating quicker postoperative recovery and mitigating postoperative pain.

Early NOTES procedures primarily involved basic tissue sampling and excisions using endoscopes equipped with rudimentary biopsy instruments. To undertake more complex surgeries, researchers developed various robotic platforms tailored for NOTES. These platforms typically feature an endoscope with an integrated camera and two robotic arms extending from the distal end, such as EndoSAMURAI [5], Cobra [6], and K-flex [7]. The precision of triangulation plays a pivotal role in the dexterity of operations using flexible endoscopes, defined as the spatial orientation between two instruments [8]. However, owing to the structural limitations of single-segmented continuous arms, achieving optimal triangulation with traditional robotic arms remains challenging. Innovations like ANUBIScope [9] and A flexible endoscopic surgical system [10] address this issue by providing passive triangulation through articulating arms."

"Although NOTES surgical robots have become a hot topic in the medical device field, there are relatively few articles introducing their control consoles. Presently, mainstream commercial consoles like the da Vinci Surgical System [11] and Hugo [12] offer 6 degrees of freedom, whereas most NOTES surgical robots only possess 4 degrees of freedom, resulting in an incompatibility between the two. To avoid redundancy in degrees of freedom, early surgical robots like EndoSAMURAI and Cobra employed purely mechanical joysticks (see figure below), requiring multiple operators for practical surgical control. However, the overly simplistic control consoles lead to suboptimal user experiences for surgeons, consequently reducing surgical efficiency and safety. Poorly designed interfaces can diminish the ergonomic effectiveness for surgeons and hinder the acceptance of robots [41], a point already validated in the design of minimally invasive surgical robots.

KFLEX has designed a simple triple-link structure for controlling flexible arms, enabling a more intuitive control for operators to grasp. Nevertheless, this design is overly simplistic, overlooking issues of human factors engineering and failing to address the issue of operational triangulation."

The modifications aim to enhance the clarity and coherence of the passage while maintaining technical accuracy. Clarifications about the compatibility issue between control consoles and the introduction of KFLEX's design are emphasized to facilitate better understanding of current challenges and advancements in the field.

"Drawing inspiration from previous works, we propose a novel endoscopic dual-channel surgical robot model capable of controlling triangulation. It comprises proximal and distal continuous segments, where the proximal segment's deflection provides active triangulation while enhancing surgical flexibility. Both proximal and distal segments collaborate to perform surgical actions. We have designed an exoskeleton-type surgical robot control console based on the degrees of freedom of this model. It allows one-to-one control of the robot's joints using five degrees of freedom from the human arm, achieving efficient intuitive control. During the initial prototype testing, we observed significant physiological tremors in the operator's hands. To mitigate tremors-induced end effector vibrations, we proposed improvement methods at both hardware and software levels. By establishing a kinematic model for the master and slave ends, we derived the mapping relationship from the control console's operational space to the end effector's configuration space and validated it in MATLAB.

The structure of this paper is as follows: Section II elaborates on the distribution of degrees of freedom at the master and slave ends, along with an introduction to the mechanical design of the control console. Section III focuses on the east-line filtering of tremors at the master end in NOTES surgical robots. Section IV derives the kinematic mapping between the control console and the flexible surgical arms. Section V provides a comprehensive summary of the entire paper."
