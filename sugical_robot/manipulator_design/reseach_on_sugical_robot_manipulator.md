# 手术机器人操作台控制器研究

key word: Surgeon Console Controls, manipulator, telemanipulator

感觉论文的核心还是应该围绕操纵端的设计，说来惭愧，连英文名都说不出来，现在知道了是manipulator（感谢gpt🙏）

Summary: The document is a technical review of the da Vinci surgical telemanipulator, a robotic system used in various surgical specialties. The review analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of the robot design based on published literature and patents. The main findings of the review are that while the da Vinci system facilitates complex surgical operations and has a low malfunction rate, it lacks haptic feedback and collisions between the robotic arms are a major limitation. Accurate positioning of access ports is also essential. The review concludes that knowledge of the technical aspects of the da Vinci robot is important for optimal use and highlights future trends in robot miniaturization and intelligent control design.

### 达芬奇三连杆结构

[专利出处](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6364888B1/en?oq=US6364888B1)

专利中把这个结构称为**[wrist gimbal]手腕万向节**；（为什么叫这个？）

专利写的很清楚，但是太啰嗦了，而我重点想研究手腕万向节
